    "2. Determine the set of data points Si which are within a distance threshold t of the model. The set Si is the consensus set of the sample and defines the inliers of S.\n",
    "3. If the size of Si (the number of inliers) is greater than some threshold T, re-estimate the model using all the points in Si and terminate.\n",
    "4. If the size of Si is less than T, select a new subset and repeat the above.\n",
    "5. After N trials the largest consensus set Si is selected, and the model is re-estimated using all the points in the subset Si."
